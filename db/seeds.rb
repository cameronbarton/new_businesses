The best part of photography to us, is feeling the energy while approaching a shoot, absorbing the moment, and clicking the shutter with our whole heart! We enjoy the pursuit of challenges. The challenge to create and deliver photographs under a myriad of circumstances. The challenge of taking the ordinary and seeing the extraordinary.",
